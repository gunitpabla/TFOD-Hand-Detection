# TFOD-Hand-Detection
This project leverages the power of the TensorFlow Object Detection API to create a real-time hand gesture recognition system. The model picked from the TensorFlow 2 Detection Model Zoo, SSD MobileNet V2 FPNLite 320x320, has been trained on a curated dataset containing labeled images of four distinct hand signs: thumbs up, thumbs down, peace sign, and Shaka sign.

The primary objective of this project is to enable machines to interpret and respond to these hand signs in real-time, offering a wide range of practical applications. By utilizing computer vision and deep learning techniques within the TensorFlow framework, it enhances accessibility and provides innovative ways for users to interact with technology.

Key features of the project include a live camera feed and overlays detected hand signs with bounding boxes and labels in real-time. The system is optimized for both accuracy and real-time performance, making it versatile and adaptable for various scenarios.

Future enhancements may include continuous model improvement through ongoing training with diverse data and model using the detection model to build different use cases such a hand free presentation slide app.
